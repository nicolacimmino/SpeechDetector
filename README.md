With this project I am exploring the possibility of recognizing speech with a low end microcontroller such as an ATmega-328. I am not expecting to recognize full sentences as this wouldn't be realistic with the hardware at hand.

I am hoping anyway to be able to at least recognize one of few words after the device has been trained with them. After all there is a very cheap chip, used in many toys alreay in the 90's, that is able to recognize few preset words, so there has to be a way to at least discern some words from others.

The hardware is a very simple board I used in many other my DSP projects, just an Arduino Nano with a microphone and a pre-amp.
